# cloudflare_dyndns_script

to run this script all you need to do is:
1. clone this repo.
2. create a .creds file in the working directory (first line MUST be your email, second line MUST be your API token or key).
3. run and test (use python3).
4. if everything works , create a cron job, every two hours is enough.

P.S: im an infrastructure engineer not a software developer, so, excuse my dirty code :D.
